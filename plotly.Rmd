# Here are some plots

Today we're making interactive plots in plotly. we'll make examples using the NYC airbnb dataset.

```{r}
library(tidyverse)
library(p8105.datasets)
library(plotly)
```

Do some initial data cleaning / subsetting.

```{r}
data(nyc_airbnb)

nyc_airbnb = 
  nyc_airbnb |> 
  mutate(rating = review_scores_location / 2) |> #making it a 5 point scale, rather than out of 10
  select(
    neighbourhood_group, neighbourhood, rating, price, room_type, lat, long) |>
  drop_na(rating) |>  
  filter(
    neighbourhood_group == "Manhattan",
    room_type == "Entire home/apt",
    price %in% 100:500
  )
```


Use plotly to make some quick plots. 

```{r}
nyc_airbnb |> 
  mutate(text_label = str_c("Price ", price, "\nNeighbourhood: ", neighbourhood)) |> 
  plot_ly(
    x = ~lat, y = ~long, color = ~price, text = ~text_label,
    type = "scatter", mode = "markers", alpha = 0.5
  )
```
